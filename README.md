# [Suave CSS 1.0](http://cluser404.github.io/suave-css)
### A scss Fork of Suave UI

[Suave UI](https://uoziod.github.io/suave-ui/demo/) was designed for web-applications based on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org).

[Suave UI Website](http://uoziod.github.io/suave-ui).

As __AngularJS__ turned into __Angular_ Suave UI became redundent.

**Suave CSS** is an effort to keep the Suave style alive.

Suave has a decent look and feel. The colors and gradients are well matched.

Special thanks to **Semyon Vyskubov** for giving the world **Suave UI**
