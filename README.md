# [Suave CSS 1.0](http://cluser404.github.io/suave-css)
### A scss Fork of Suave UI

#### [Suave UI original git repo](http://uoziod.github.io/suave-ui).

[Suave UI](https://uoziod.github.io/suave-ui/demo/) was designed for web-applications based on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org).

As AngularJS turned into Angular Suave UI became redundent.
Suave CSS is an effort to keep the Suave style alive.
Suave has a decent look and feel. The colors and gradients are well matched.

Special thanks to Semyon Vyskubov for giving the world Suave UI

Then you can use Suave directives, services and styles right in your code.
